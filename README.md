# Psychic-Game
A simple guess the number type game. The Computer generate a random number between 1 and 100, you will have 10 guesses to get the answer right by putting only numbers into the guess field.
After each turn the player is told if they are right or wrong â€” and, if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It also tells the player what numbers they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, they are given an option to start playing again.

### Game Functions:
Generate a random number between 1 and 100.  - Line 5 JS file

    It also counts down from 10 and displays the guesses remaining to the player in a scoreboard area. - Lines 15, 51, & 56 JS File 
Provide the player with a way to guess what the number is. - HTML <form> element with Class of guessField
    Once a guess has been submitted first record it somewhere so the user can see their previous guesses. - HTML <div> element with class resultParas
